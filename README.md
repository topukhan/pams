# Project Allocation and Management System (PAMS)

PAMS (Project Allocation and Management System) is a comprehensive project management tool designed to streamline the process of managing final year projects for university students. The system facilitates various tasks such as group formation, project proposal submission, report submission, project allocation, marking, communication, and analytics.

## Features

- **User Roles:** The system includes three main user roles: Students, Supervisors, and Coordinators.

- **Project Proposal:** Students can create project groups, submit project proposals, and request supervisor approval.

- **Supervisor Interaction:** Supervisors can review and accept project proposals, provide feedback, and allocate projects to specific teams.

- **Coordinator's Role:** Coordinators have similar features to supervisors and can also allocate supervisors and projects to teams.

- **Phases and Marking:** The project is divided into phases. Each team's work is marked by supervisors during each phase.

- **Final Allocation:** Projects are finally allocated to teams after confirmation from both the supervisor and coordinator.

- **Communication:** A messaging system facilitates communication among users.

- **Notifications:** Users receive notifications about project updates and deadlines.

- **Analytics:** The system provides insights and analytics on project progress.
